# Paragraph Examples
Run a manual sweep of anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings. Radiation levels in our atmosphere have increased by 3,000 percent. Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization. What is the strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum output? The wormhole's size and short period would make this a local phenomenon. Do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic simulation?

After two 'Enters', we could start a new paragraph. Only one 'Enter' is not working. There is the other name called " Hard-break. " It is "two spaces + Enter" and can force a sentance changing line.  
Like this line. 

# Heading
Two approaches: 1. Use '====' and '----' means H1 and H2

Heading 1
========
and
Heading 2
------------
2. Use '#' one to six for headings. The differentce is there is one line under method 1. 

# Emphasis
You could use Method 1) _xxx_ or *yyy* or 2) __xxx__ or **yyy**  
The problem is you may confused something like this I_am_Trina.
you could use I\_am\_Trina instead. 

# Quotes
Here is an example of quotation. We use '>' to make this happen.
>USS Exeter - NCC-1672 - All crew lost killed by alien disease except Captain Ronald Tracey who was on the planet surface when the disease struck the crew. 
##### _somebody said so_

We like to use 5 '#' and '_xxx_' to put under the quote.

# Code Style or Block
There are two methods too. Method 1) using `` Ex. `printf()`  
Method 2) Leave 4 spaces ' ' in front of code lines. Ex.  
    cd ~
    ls
    #ssss
And go back to normal without spaces.

# List Examples
You could use * + - these three symbols to lead list. Ex.  
* Supermicro
+ Dell
- HP
( Please just pick one of them for constiance. It's only an example. )  

Second example: Ex. 
* TOS
* TNG
* DS9
* STV

Or you could just start using numbers with sapce. Ex.
1. STE
2. STD
4. Short Trek
5. Picard
3. Lower Decks

(Becareful, the numbers is not consitant what you see in the output window, some editor will reorder it for output.)
